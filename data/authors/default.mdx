I love mathematics, programming, writing, speaking, and tennis. In the spare time, I contribute to open source software and research on different topics including ML systems, investment, and robotics. 

Recently, I decide to write more blogs so we can have high-quality human generated content. I am very concerned about the pollution of AI generated content to the internet. Writing is one way to fight against such trend. When humanity is on the brink of extinction, in addition to the genetic atlas and seed banks, we should also preserve the original works of human literature.

Career-wise, I am currently building Large Language Models at Boson AI, led by Dr.Mu Li and Dr.Alex Smola. The possibility of now and the future is only bounded by our imaginations.

Yesterdays, once passed, become whispers in the winds of time:

- <s>Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Robinhood, democratizing finance for all.</s>
- <s>Machine Learning Engineer at Google Cloud AI, building systems for ML applications.</s>
- <s>Data Scientist at Uptake, built an internal machine learning framework for industrial time series.</s>
- <s>Software Engineer at MathWorks, core developer of predictive maintenance toolbox.</s>
- <s>Mechanical Engineer at DJI, worked on manufacturing and aerodynamics.</s>
