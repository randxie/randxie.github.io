I love mathematics, programming, writing, speaking, and tennis. In the spare time, I enjoy contributing to open source and researching on different topics including ML systems, streaming computation, and computer vision.

The possibility of now and the future is only bounded by our imaginations.

Yesterdays, once passed, become whispers in the winds of time:

- <s>Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Robinhood, democratizing finance for all.</s>
- <s>Machine Learning Engineer at Google Cloud AI, building systems for ML applications.</s>
- <s>Data Scientist at Uptake, built an internal machine learning framework for industrial time series.</s>
- <s>Software Engineer at MathWorks, core developer of predictive maintenance toolbox.</s>
- <s>Mechanical Engineer at DJI, worked on manufacturing and aerodynamics.</s>
