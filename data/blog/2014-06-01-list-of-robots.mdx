In 2014, I worked with a team of school mates from different engineering/science backgrounds to participate in a model aircraft competition [design, build and fly](http://www.aiaadbf.org/). We ranked 34th out of 80 in the competition. You can find our aircraft [here](https://aero.mae.ust.hk/dbf-competition-2014/).

In 2013, I designed and manufactured a 3-axis CNC machine that is capable of carving on acrylic board. More details are in my [Zhihu answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/22794693/answer/36840728).

In 2011, I worked with a team of school mates from different engineering disciplines to participate in a robot contest. We won the first runner-up in the Hong Kong regional competition. Checkout the competition video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMo0759PkV0).
