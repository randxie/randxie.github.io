To me, the most inspiring moments for writing occur when I am on a trip. The constant movement from one place to another serves as a catalyst for my thoughts. Today, I embarked on a flight from SFO to Hong Kong, and during the journey, I decided to watch a movie titled "Already Tomorrow in Hong Kong." As someone who spent four years studying in Hong Kong, it was nearly impossible for me to resist the allure of this film.

The story revolves around Ruby Lin, a Chinese-American girl who visits Hong Kong for the first time. Throughout her journey, she encounters Josh Rosenberg, an American expat, and engages in numerous thought-provoking discussions about culture, life, and more. Despite their deep connection, they refrain from pursuing a romantic relationship due to their existing partners.
While I am not particularly interested in their complicated emotional state or whether they eventually become a couple, there were some scenes in the movie that sparked my contemplation.

### Cultural Identity

Ruby's parents immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong, but despite living with them, she knows very little about her parents' homeland and does not speak Mandarin or Cantonese. This is a common choice for second-generation immigrants, as they often embrace the local culture and disregard their origins.

I do not intend to criticize this phenomenon, as I am well aware of the challenges faced by second-generation individuals. However, I have chosen a different path for my daughter, as I believe that cultural identity is one of the most valuable inheritances I can provide for her. That is why I have enrolled her in a preschool in China, where she can become fluent in Chinese and gain a deep understanding of Chinese culture. Moreover, this experience will enable her to develop an unbiased perspective towards China.

### The Freedom of Choice is a Priviledge

During the conversation, Ruby and Josh were discussing Monica's inability to understand Josh's decision to quit his job and pursue his dream of becoming a writer. While Ruby and Josh were criticizing Monica for her lack of understanding, I would like to offer a different perspective: pursuing one's dream is a privilege. Many individuals are constrained by the harsh realities of life and are unable to freely pursue their passions, e.g. due to financial constraints. Another example, obtaining a green card in the United States is a significant barrier that limits the capabilities of many individuals to chase their dreams.

Note: Monica was Josh's girlfriend.

### So, how's the movie?

Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching, especially for those who have experienced the unique blend of Chinese and Western culture. However, there is still room for the movie to delve deeper into certain topics like cultural identity.
